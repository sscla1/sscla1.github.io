    <p>
	***I do not provide personal investment advice and I am not a qualified licensed investment advisor. I am an amateur investor. I will not and cannot be held liable for any actions you take as a result of !buyalert. This application is strictly to be used for testing purposes.***</p>
    <p>what is !buyalert?</p>
    <p>!buyalert is a notification-based application for option strikes. the algorithm is constantly updated to keep up with the markets and new data.</p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE:</p>
<p>  !buyalert returns strikes with: IV >20%, Delta close to -0.5, Gamma between 50 and 60, and the lowest absolute Theta value. It does not (yet) return strikes that magically has a 100% success rate. Personally, I will use this to supplement other data to ensure a play is aligned with the fundamentals, which !buyalert currently provides. In the next several weeks, !buyalert will include data as well, to be the one place which meets all stock market needs.</p>

<p>version <2.0 is a BETA. DO NOT use this as the sole reason for any investing decision, this application is at best for finding plays.</p>
    <p>where is the website?</p>
    <p>this is currently the only site for !buyalert, a full dynamic website will be available soon.</p>
