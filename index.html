    <h1>!buyalert on iOS (Android soon)</h1>
    <p>

    <p>what is !buyalert?</p>
    <p>!buyalert is a notification-based application for option strikes. the algorithm is constantly updated to keep up with the markets and new data.</p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE:</p>
<p>  !buyalert returns strikes with: IV >20%, Delta close to -0.5, Gamma between 50 and 60, and the lowest absolute Theta value. In theory you'd receive a notification, set a buy order at the bid, then once filled set a sell order at the ask. HOWEVER it does not (yet) return strikes that magically have a 100% success rate, or even 50%. Personally, I will use this to supplement other data to ensure a play is aligned with the fundamentals, until !buyalert includes all data as well, & is the one place to meet all stock market needs.</p>

<p>version <2.0 is a BETA. DO NOT use this as the sole reason for any investing decision, this application is at best for finding plays.</p>
    <p>where is the website?</p>
    <p>this is currently the only site for !buyalert, a full dynamic website will be available soon.</p>
